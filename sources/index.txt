Welcome to the JinjaTag documentation
=======================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

The jinjatag library makes it easy to take a python function and turn it
into an extension for jinja2.

The library provides a set of decorators for common tasks that can be
sent to decorators.

See https://github.com/mankyd/jinjatag/ for source and issues.

Module Contents
---------------

JinjaTag Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: jinjatag.JinjaTag()

   The ``JinjaTag`` extension that needs to be registered with the jinja2
   environment to enable all of the decorated functions. You must register
   an instance of this with your jinja2 environment to use. For example::

    >>> import jinjatag
    >>> jinja_tag = jinjatag.JinjaTag()
    >>> jinja2_env = Environment(extensions=[jinja_tag])
    >>> jinja_tag.init()

   .. CAUTION::
      Use only one JinjaTag instance per jinja2 environment.

.. method:: JinjaTag.init()

   This method of JinjaTag will complete the decorator registration with
   jinja2. This must be called on the JinjaTag instance after adding it
   to the jinja2 environment but before any template is compiled/rendered.
   Must be called *after* registering the ``JinjaTag`` instance with jinja2.
   Running ``init`` before registering with the jinja2 environment will break.

Decorators
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. staticmethod:: jinjatag.simple_tag(name=None)
                  jinjatag.simple_tag(func)

    This decorator wraps a single function to produce a simple tag that
    can be called in any template using the jinja2 environment registered
    above.

    The name for the tag can either be specified as the name argument or taken
    as the name of the wrapped function. In the simplest form, you can
    just put ``@jinjatag.simple_tag`` at the top of your function and just
    use it as a macro::

     import jinjatag

     @jinjatag.simple_tag
     def my_simple_tag(width, height=None):
         height = width if height is None else height
         return '<br>'.join('=' * width for _ in range(height))

    In the jinja2 template, just call the ``my_simple_tag`` as you might
    expect::

     {% my_simple_tag width=5 height=5*2 %}

    The tag's syntax is simple: every argument *must* be passed by name with
    no commas between them.

    To specify the name argument, simply pass it as the first argument
    when calling the decorator::

     @jinjatag.simple_tag(name='my_other_tag')
     def my_simple_tag(width, height=None):
         . . .

.. staticmethod:: jinjatag.simple_block(name=None)
                  jinjatag.simple_block(func)

    The ``simple_block`` decorator represents a single wrapped block of
    content. For instance, suppose we want to implement the block tag
    caesar cipher, which shifts every letter in the block by a defined
    amount. That tag might look like::

     @jinjatag.simple_block
     def caesar_cipher(body, shift=13):
         ''.join(chr((ord(c) - 96 + shift) % 26 + 96)
                             if c.islower() else c for c in body)

    Then to use it in a template, you would just have to write::

     {% caesar_cipher shift=10 %}
       the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
       {% if 1 %}
       raising elephants is so utterly boring.
       {% endif %}
     {% end_caesar_cipher %}

    Note the use of 'end_' to determine the endblock. Jinja2 convention
    does not use an underscore, so the simple_block allows you to choose
    which convention --- both will work. If the tag contains an underscore,
    you will likely be more inclined to separate the end with an underscore.
